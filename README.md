# word-distance-calculator

This little script intends to calculate what distance do you have to travel with your fingers in order to type words. After treating 646543 words in Spanish and excluding conflictive characters in C++ such as _á_ and _ñ_ I've concluded that the word that you need to make your fingers travel the most in order to type it is: **desprofesionalizariamos** with a distance of 93.101 cm (assuming that two adjacent keys are separated by 1 cm and two letter that are one above another are also separated by 1 cm and with a ortholinear keyboard).

In the future I'll make a script that will be able to process this conflictive characters but at the moment I don't have the knowledge to do that yet.
